# mizu

This codebase is directly adapted from the [yuzu
emulator](https://github.com/yuzu-emu/yuzu), but is heavily modified to gut all
the kernel / ARM emulation in favor of running natively under the [arm64 Horizon
Linux kernel](https://github.com/kentjhall/horizon-linux) as a persistent
systemd service. This service handles the concurrent execution of necessary
Nintendo Switch system services, GPU emulation, and a loader for Horizon apps.

## WIP

What's here is far from complete or being thoroughly tested. There's a lot of
hamfisted synchronization I added to try and run the Switch services in separate
threads (like real services would), but as a result, I'm fairly certain that
most of it is buggy and/or unoptimized. Generally, the major TODOs include:

- Improve the synchronization situation.

- Ensure multiple Horizon programs can be serviced at once.

- The build system!! It's garbage right now, just one convoluted Makefile and
  every header is a dependency of everything. Ideally I figure out CMake at some
  point.

Additionally, not all the services copied here from yuzu are actually supported
yetâ€”I've only bothered porting the ones which I've needed for the games I've
tried to run up to this point. Likely more of those will need to be updated for
running under Horizon Linux in the future.

But once these things are sorted, the main focus should be porting over any
important yuzu features / improvements that have occurred since I ripped their
codebase.

## Build/install

This is tested to build on Debian 11 and Fedora Rawhide (post-Fedora 36).

Note that I recommend testing on Debian 11; Fedora Rawhide is supported because
I wanted to test with the latest graphics API that macOS virtualization
presently has to offer, but Debian is far more stable (I frequently get hangups
doing common things in Fedora, e.g. building this project with too many
threads). Also Fedora seems to not start the mizu service automatically on login
since the graphical-session target is never triggered (likely a bug?), so that's
kind of annoying.

First install the required dependencies...

for Debian:
```
# apt install cmake qtbase5-dev qtbase5-private-dev qtbase5-dev-tools libglfw3-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavfilter-dev libavformat-dev libavresample-dev libavutil-dev libpostproc-dev libswresample-dev libswscale-dev libopus-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev glslang-tools liblz4-dev libboost-dev nlohmann-json3-dev libzstd-dev
```

for Fedora:
```
# dnf install make cmake gcc gcc-c++ qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtbase-private-devel glfw-devel.aarch64 ffmpeg-free-devel.aarch64 opus-devel.aarch64 libusb1-devel.aarch64 libusb1.aarch64 glslang-devel.aarch64 lz4-devel.aarch64 boost-devel json-devel libzstd-devel
```

Then run:
```
$ make -j$(nproc)
```

Or (alternatively) if you want the older OpenGL 4.3 GPU emulation, then:
```
$ make VIDEO_CORE_COMPAT=y -j$(nproc)
```

And to install:
```
# make install
```
